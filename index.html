    		<h1>BlightStatus</h1>
    		<h2>THE PROBLEM:</h2>
    		<p class="subheading">
    			Residents were bombarding City Hall with questions and repeated complaints about blighted buildings in their neighborhoods.
    		</p>
    		<div class="img-left">
    			<img src="images/Miss_Ritas_spreadsheet_@2x.jpg" alt="NOLA resident's spreadsheet with handwritten notes and highlighting" max-width="450px">

    		</div>
    		<!-- <img src="images/Miss_Ritas_spreadsheet_@2x.jpg" alt="NOLA resident's spreadsheet with handwritten notes and highlighting" max-width="900px"> -->
    		<p>
    			From my initial kickoff meeting with my client, the City of New Orleans, my team & I learned that frustrated residents were compiling their own lists of vacant & deteriorating buildings in their neighborhoods, and bringing maps & spreadsheets to City Hall saying “do something about this!”
    		</p>
    		<p>
    			City Hall didn’t have the means to process this feedback effectively, or to give residents satisfactory answers, even though they were actively working to remediate these blighted properties. Residents were dissatisfied and City staffers were overloaded.
    		</p>
    		<h3>The City's initial hypothesis:</h3>
    		<p class="subheading">
    			Residents must need an easier way to complain about multiple addresses at a time to the City’s service-request system, 311.
    		</p>
            <div class="img-left">
                <img src="images/harmony_photowall_@2x.jpg" alt="NOLA non-profit's photo-based system for tracking blighted properties" max-width="450px">

                <img src="images/Miss_Ritas_map_@2x.jpg" alt="NOLA resident's hand-colored map indicating neighborhood property conditions" max-width="450px">
            </div>
    		<h2>OUR APPROACH:</h2>
    		<p class="subheading">
    			Visiting residents in their homes or offices to observe their concerns and workflows firsthand.
    		</p>
    		<p>
    			Through extensive field research with residents citywide, my team & I learned why residents were compiling information about blighted properties and presenting it to the City. 
    		</p>
    		<p>
    			Because it was nearly impossible to find any coherent information about these problem properties on the City’s website, <span class="bold-italic-inline">residents assumed that the City didn’t know these properties were problems in the first place,</span> and that they weren’t doing anything to fix them up.
    		</p>
    		<p>
    			However, by shadowing a number of City staffers involved in the process of remediating vacant property, we learned that the City in fact does have extremely detailed information about the status of all of these properties, and in most cases, is actively working to remediate them.
    		</p>
            <h3>The City was close, but they had it backwards:</h3>
            <p class="subheading">
                Residents just needed a simple way to find out what the City was already doing to remediate blighted properties in their neighborhood.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hypothesized that if the City made it easier for residents to access info about blighted properties online, the City would see fewer complaints and questions.
            </p>
            <h2>TESTING OUR HYPOTHESIS:</h2>
            <p>
                Once the problem was defined and stakeholders were aligned around the hypothesis, my team and I got to work identifying the minimum amount of functionality we could include in the initial app prototype to help test our new hypothesis with residents. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We consulted our interview notes to create personas for the key user groups and captured their primary pain points, needs, and motivations on post-it notes. By organizing & categorizing these post-its, we were able to define the most critical user flows for the initial app prototype, and begin sketching out some rough wireframes. 
            </p>

            </div>
            <h2>RELEASING THE MVP:</h2>
            <p>
                Once we had the minimally viable version of the app built, we released it to the public for further testing in the wild. Residents immediately “got it” - we saw a lot of adoption, and got the following feedback from many early users: 
            </p>
            <p class="subheading">
                “This is very important and I think more folks will get involved when they see what you have done to help us get all the data that we need in one place. What a great day for New Orleans!”
            </p>
            <p class="subheading">
                “We have been working on this stuff for years, and this is the first time in a long time that it seems like things are actually happening with blighted properties moving through the pipeline and something happening with them. Pretty awesome.”
            </p>

            <h2>ONGOING ITERATION:</h2>
            <p>
                Ever since then, the app has been live and continues to see traffic every day. The app is now supported through our SaaS company Civic Insight, so I continue to beta-test new features with our users, and make enhancements & adjustments based on feedback we receive via UserVoice, via periodic surveys I conduct using Google Forms, and through monitoring our web analytics for any changes in user behavior.
