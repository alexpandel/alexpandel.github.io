    		<h1>BlightStatus</h1>
    		<h2>THE PROBLEM:</h2>
    		<p>
    			Residents were bombarding City Hall with questions and repeated complaints about blighted buildings in their neighborhoods.
    		</p>
    		<p>
    			From my initial kickoff meeting with my client, the City of New Orleans, my team & I learned that frustrated residents were compiling their own lists of vacant & deteriorating buildings in their neighborhoods, and bringing maps & spreadsheets to City Hall saying “do something about this!”
    		</p>
    		<p>
    			City Hall didn’t have the means to process this feedback effectively, or to give residents satisfactory answers, even though they were actively working to remediate these blighted properties. Residents were dissatisfied and City staffers were overloaded.
